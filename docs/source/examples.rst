Examples
========

There are two example blueprints in
```cardassembler_data`` `<../../tree/master/CardAssembler_Data>`__
folder. One shows very simple blueprint to start with. The second one
shows intended use.

Simple
------

``Blueprint_Example_Simple.xml`` shows very simple blueprint to make
sense of how this plug-in works.

The only card there can be created by filling ``example`` into CardIDs
field.

Full
----

``Blueprint_Example_Full.xml`` shows intended usage including structure
to make adding more similar items easier and clearer.

The only card there can be created by filling ``unique spell example``
into CardIDs field. Colors can be exported by filling ``color`` into
`PaletteID field <README.md#palette-creator-parameters>`__.
